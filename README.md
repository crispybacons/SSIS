Student Information System Web App using HTML/CCS/PHP


This is my first web app so if there are errors please bear with me, this was created when I was on my highschool years. 

I created it using HTML, CCS, and PHP.

To use this system you must:

1. Download XAMPP in your device
2. Import the database (capstone101.sql) into the phpmyadmin
3. And then you're good to go!
